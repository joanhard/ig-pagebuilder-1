This is a drag-n-drop page builder which is similar to an advanced visual editor and can use for any theme.

What makes IG Page Builder stand-out from others is focusing on simplicity, lightweight and really useful, so that making your own unique website becomes easier than ever.

In order to offer the easiest way to build a website, IG Page Builder includes full page elements (built-in shortcodes) for a fully functional website. Besides, it also totally supports adding any widget and many options for deeper customization, so there is no need to touch any code. All the elements are specifically designed with 2 configuration sections: one tab for building content and the other for taking a visual look of what you are doing without having to go back into the front-end.

In addition, the page builder is equipped fully responsive functionality; your site will automatically adjust its layout and look more fantastic on whatever devices which your customers are using.

You can constantly use this page builder as a starter tool for your website building project. With IG PageBuilder, nothing is impossible.
